Docifly is a documentation theme for Jigyll. It uses stock Starlight as the reference for its appearance and responsive behavior, not the customized Starlight website.

This documentation site runs Docifly. You can try its sidebar, heading links, table of contents, code blocks, and color selector right here.

## Start with a working site

Read [Getting started](./getting-started/) to install Docifly and configure your site. You don't need to install Node.js, Astro, or Sass to use the shipped theme.

Then organize your [navigation](./navigation/), write [headings](./headings/), and choose a [deployment location](./deployment/).

## Explore the examples

- [Markdown](./markdown/) shows lists, tables, images, quotations, and inline formatting alongside authoring examples.
- [Code blocks](./code/) shows highlighted code, whitespace, and horizontal overflow. Try copying a block.
- [Color modes](./color-modes/) explains Dark, Light, and Auto, including what happens without JavaScript or storage.
- [Manual inspection](./inspection/) suggests ways to try the site with a keyboard and at different window sizes.

## Understand the implementation

[Theme internals](./internals/) explains what the layouts, includes, Sass, and browser enhancements do. These docs are plain Markdown in a separate site with Docifly installed. They need no browser test runner or documentation preprocessing.

## Scope and limitations

Docifly has documentation and splash layouts with optional heroes. It supports recursive navigation, heading navigation, Markdown and code formatting, color modes, and local full-text search. Each feature's docs describe the supported components and output.

Visual parity means matching appearances under a defined set of conditions. Interaction parity means matching observable control behavior. Trying this site by hand does not prove that it fully matches stock Starlight in either respect.

The repository's `docs/poc.md` and `evidence/poc/` contain historical proof-of-concept results. The tools that captured those results have been retired, so they are not a current measurement of this documentation site.
